Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) is India's independent regional
                    navigation satellite system designed to provide accurate Position, Velocity and Timing (PVT) service
                    to users in India as well as to region extending about 1500 km beyond Indian land mass.
NavIC will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service
                    (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS). NavIC's SPS provides a position accuracy of better than 20 m (2σ)
                    and timing accuracy better than 40 ns (2σ) over the service area.
ISRO successfully completed a century in the launches from its spaceport at Sriharikota on January 29, 2025 with the 17thlaunch of GSLV. In this mission NVS-02 navigation satellite was successfully injected into the intended Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. All the launch vehicle stages performed flawlessly and the orbit was achieved with a high degree of precision.
Subsequent to the launch, the solar panels on board the satellite were successfully deployed and power generation is nominal. Communication with the ground station has been established. But the orbit raising operations towards positioning the satellite to the designated orbital slot could not be carried out as the valves for admitting the oxidizer to fire the thrusters for orbit raising did not open.
The satellite systems are healthy and the satellite is currently in elliptical orbit. Alternate mission strategies for utilising the satellite for navigation in an elliptical orbit is being worked out.",GSLV-F15/NVS-02 MISSION

SpaDeX mission is a cost-effective technology demonstrator mission for the demonstration of in-space
                    docking using two small spacecraft launched by PSLV. This technology is essential for India's space
                    ambitions such as Indian on Moon, sample return from the Moon, the building and operation of
                    Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), etc. In-space docking technology is essential when multiple
                    rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. Through this mission, India is
                    marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology.
The primary objective of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for
                    rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft (SDX01, which is the Chaser, and SDX02,
                    the Target, nominally) in a low-Earth circular orbit. Secondary objectives include:
The SpaDeX mission consists of two small spacecraft (about 220 kg each) to be launched by PSLV-C60,
                    independently and simultaneously, into a 470 km circular orbit at 55° inclination, with a local time
                    cycle of about 66 days. The demonstrated precision of the PSLV vehicle will be utilized to give a
                    small relative velocity between the Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the
                    launch vehicle. This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km
                    inter-satellite separation with respect to the Chaser within a day. At this point, the relative
                    velocity between the Target will be compensated using the propulsion system of the Target
                    spacecraft.
At the end of this drift arrest maneuver, the Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with
                    identical velocity but separated by about 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous. With a similar strategy of
                    introducing and then compensating for a small relative velocity between the two spacecraft, the
                    Chaser will approach the Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5
                    km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft. After
                    successful docking and rigidization, electrical power transfer between the two satellites will be
                    demonstrated before undocking and separation of the two satellites to start the operation of their
                    respective payloads for the expected mission life of up to two years.
The indigenous technologies developed for enabling this docking mission are as follows:
In addition, SpaDeX, because of its small size and mass, is even more challenging due to the finer
                    precision required for the rendezvous and docking maneuvers compared to docking two large
                    spacecraft. This mission will be a forerunner for autonomous docking needed for future lunar
                    missions like Chandrayaan-4 without the support of GNSS from Earth.
The docking mechanism is a low-impact docking system (approach velocity is in the order of 10 mm/s),
                    androgynous (docking systems are identical for both spacecraft, Chaser & Target), and is a
                    peripheral docking system (concept similar to the International Docking System Standard used by
                    other agencies for human missions). The mechanism is smaller (450 mm) with one degree of freedom for
                    extension and uses two motors compared to the IDSS (800 mm) on a hexapod with 24 motors. Multiple
                    test beds were established to test the hardware and software simulation of the docking kinematics to
                    verify and finalise the docking approach parameters.
The additional sensor suite in this mission includes Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Corner Cube Retro
                    Reflectors to work for a range of 6000 to 200 m for determining range (R). The set of Rendezvous
                    Sensors (RS) is used in the range of 2000 to 250 m and from 250-10 m. RS provides the relative
                    position (x, y, z) while LRF determines both relative position and velocity independently.
Proximity and Docking Sensor (PDS) provides relative position and velocity over a range of 30 m to
                    0.4 m. Laser Diodes (LDs) are used as targets for RS & PDS. A video monitor is used in the 20 to 0.5
                    m range and it will capture the video of the docking event. A Mechanism Entry Sensor (MES) is used
                    from 8 cm to 4 cm to detect chaser entry into the target spacecraft during docking. Multiple test
                    beds were used to calibrate and validate these sensors before accepting them for the mission.
Like all ISRO satellites in low-Earth orbit, both the SpaDeX spacecraft carry a differential
                    GNSS-based Satellite Positioning System (SPS), which provides PNT (Position, Navigation, and Timing)
                    solutions for the satellites. In SpaDeX, a novel RODP processor is included in the SPS receiver,
                    which allows accurate determination of the relative position and velocity of the Chaser and the
                    Target. By subtracting the carrier phase measurements from the same GNSS satellites in both Chaser
                    and Target SPS receivers, highly accurate relative states of the two satellites are determined. The
                    VHF/UHF transceivers in both satellites aid this process by transferring the GNSS satellite
                    measurements from one satellite to the other. Hardware and software test beds, including closed-loop
                    verifications, were carried out to characterise the RODP performance.
Up to an inter-satellite distance (ISD) of 5 km, standard orbit maintenance and attitude control
                    algorithms employed in ISRO LEO spacecraft are used. As the spacecraft are in circular orbit, and
                    any addition or reduction of velocity to the satellites will result in orbit change, the V-bar
                    strategy using n-Pulse, Glideslope and PV guidance algorithms are employed to reduce the ISD between
                    the satellites, hold at fixed ISDs to evaluate the sensors and software, and finally docking. These
                    algorithms were converted into software for achieving the rendezvous and docking. These software
                    solutions were tested and validated in multiple digital, hardware-in-loop, onboard-in-loop,
                    software-in-loop, and robotic simulations.
After the docking and undocking events, the spacecrafts will be separated and used for application
                    missions.
The SpaDeX spacecraft were designed and realized by the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with the
                    support of other ISRO centers (VSSC, LPSC, SAC, IISU, and LEOS). The spacecraft, in its orbital
                    phase, will be controlled from ISTRAC using ISRO ground stations and other externally hired ground
                    stations. The full integration and testing of the satellite were carried out at M/s Ananth
                    Technologies, Bangalore, under the supervision of URSC. Presently, after completing all tests and
                    clearances, the spacecraft has moved from URSC to SDSC and is undergoing preparations for launch.",PSLV C60/SPADEX Mission

GSAT-N2 had reached its final Geostationary orbit and is slowly drifting to its final orbital slot of 68 deg E longitude in a weeks’ time. Weighing 4700 kg, GSAT-N2 is a high-throughput satellite (HTS) operating in the Ka-Ka band, with a capacity of 48 Gbps. It is designed to meet broadband and in-flight connectivity needs across India. The satellite features 32 spot beams, ensuring nationwide coverage, including the remote regions of the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. The satellite was developed by UR Rao Satellite Centre with communication payloads from Space Application Centre, ISRO for NSIL. GSAT-N2 satellite is the second demand-driven communication satellite mission undertaken by New Space India Limited (NSIL), a Government of India enterprise under the Department of Space (DoS).
Launch:
GSAT-N2 was successfully launched on November 19, 2024, aboard a Falcon-9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, USA. The launcher placed spacecraft into a Super Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 250 km, apogee of 59,730 km and an orbital Inclination of 27.5 degree.
Satellite Control:
After separation from the launcher, ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan took over the operations. Initial data confirmed good health and stability of the satellite. The satellite's orbit was raised from GTO to Geo-Stationary Orbit (GSO) using its onboard chemical propulsion system developed by LPSC, ISRO while being controlled by MCF. Later all the three reflectors of the antennae were deployed successfully. The final trimming of the orbit by the propulsion system was completed and the system was safely isolated. Based on the propulsion system performance, there is adequate fuel left in the spacecraft to ensure its full operational life.
Next Steps:
The satellite will undergo elaborate In-Orbit Testing (IOT) in the coming days along with the ground communication infrastructure to verify the operation and performance of the communication payloads. Operational services are expected to commence from 68° East longitude after successful testing.",Falcon-9

Aditya-L1 is a satellite dedicated to the comprehensive study of the Sun. It has 7 distinct payloads developed, all developed indigenously. Five by ISRO and two by Indian academic institutes in collaboration with ISRO.
Aditya in Sanskrit means the Sun. L1 here refers to Lagrange Point 1 of the Sun-Earth system. For common understanding, L1 is a location in space where the gravitational forces of two celestial bodies, such as the Sun and Earth, are in equilibrium. This allows an object placed there to remain relatively stable with respect to both celestial bodies.
Following its scheduled launch on September 2, 2023, Aditya-L1 stays Earth-bound orbits for 16 days, during which it undergoes 5 maneuvres to gain the necessary velocity for its journey. Subsequently, Aditya-L1 undergoes a Trans-Lagrangian1 insertion maneuvre, marking the beginning of its 110-day trajectory to the destination around the L1 Lagrange point. Upon arrival at the L1 point, another maneuvre binds Aditya-L1 to an orbit around L1, a balanced gravitational location between the Earth and the Sun. The satellite spends its whole mission life orbiting around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a plane roughly perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun.
The strategic placement at the L1 Lagrange point ensures that Aditya-L1 can maintain a constant, uninterrupted view of the Sun. This location also allows the satellite to access solar radiation and magnetic storms before they are influenced by Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Additionally, the L1 point’s gravitational stability minimizes the need for frequent orbital maintenance efforts, optimizing the satellite's operational efficiency.
Quick Facts: Aditya-L1 will stay approximately 1.5 million km away from Earth, directed towards the Sun, which is about 1% of the Earth-Sun distance. The Sun is a giant sphere of gas and Aditya-L1 would study the outer atmosphere of the Sun. Aditya-L1 will neither land on the Sun nor approach the Sun any closer.",PSLV-C57/Aditya-L1 Mission

It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.
Lander payloads:Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.
Rover payloads:Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.
Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface.  The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM.   Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.
The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:

To achieve the mission objectives, several advanced technologies are present in Lander such as,

To demonstrate the above said advanced technologies in earth condition, several Lander special tests have been planned and carried out successfully viz.

                                        the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) space segment. Its
                                        predecessors, IRNSS-1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E were successfully launched by
                                        PSLV-C22, PSLV-C24, PSLV-C26, PSLV-C27 and PSLV-C31 in July 2013, April 2014,
                                        October 2014, March 2015 and January 2016 respectively. All the five satellites
                                        are functioning satisfactorily from their designated orbital positions.
IRNSS-1F has a lift-off mass of 1425 kg. The configuration of IRNSS-1F is similar
                                    to that of IRNSS-1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E. The two solar arrays of IRNSS-1F
                                    consisting of Ultra Triple Junction solar cells generate about 1660 Watts of
                                    electrical power. Sun and Star sensors as well as gyroscopes provide orientation
                                    reference for the satellite. Special thermal control schemes have been designed
                                    and implemented for some of the critical elements such as atomic clocks. The
                                    Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) of IRNSS-1F maintains the satellite's
                                    orientation with the help of reaction wheels, magnetic torques and thrusters.
                                    Its propulsion system consists of a Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) and thrusters.
IRNSS -1F carries two types of payloads – navigation payload and ranging payload.
                                    The navigation payload of IRNSS-1F transmits navigation service signals to the
                                    users. This payload is operating in L5-band and S-band. A highly accurate
                                    Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. The
                                    ranging payload of IRNSS-1F consists of a C-band transponder, which facilitates
                                    accurate determination of the range of the satellite. IRNSS-1F also carries
                                    Corner Cube Retro Reflectors for laser ranging.
IRNSS-1F was launched by PSLV-C32 into a sub Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub
                                    GTO) on March 10, 2016 at 16:01 hrs (IST) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC)

AstroSat carries a total of five scientific payloads enabling imaging, studying temporal and spectral properties of galactic and extra- galactic cosmic sources in a wide range of wavelengths on a common platform.
The unique feature of this observatory is its capability for carrying out broad band simultaneous multi-wavelength observation going from far ultra violet to gamma rays. UVIT has the highest angular resolution of 1.5 arc sec which is 3 times better than the next best UV telescope (GALEX-Galaxy evolution explorer) operational today. LAXPC has the highest collecting area in comparison to any other X-ray detector till today. CZTI possesses a unique capability of measuring X-ray polarization and also acts as an open detector beyond 100 keV.

ISRO has become the fourth space agency to successfully send a spacecraft to Mars orbit.Though the designed mission life is 6 months, MOM completed 7 years in its orbit on Sept 24, 2021.
The objectives of this mission are primarily technological and include design, realisation and launch of a Mars Orbiter spacecraft capable of operating with sufficient autonomy during the journey phase; Mars orbit insertion / capture and in-orbit phase around Mars.   MOM carries five scientific payloads to study the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere.
Mars continues to be an object of keen interest to scientists in the context of planetary evolution and extra-terrestrial life. Based on our understanding of Mars, which was thought to be probably a warm and wet planet earlier, is now seen to be dry with a thin atmosphere. How this evolution has taken place is still a topic of research. In this backdrop, the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission carried the following five scientific payloads:



The main objective of the Mars Colour camera therefore is:
The salient features of this instrument are given below: -


The Primary science objective of this payload is to detect and measure methane concentration in Martian atmosphere (if it does exist) under clear sky conditions.Other studies which are possible are:
The instrument features are given below: -


This spectrometer operates in the thermal infrared (TIR) region (7 micron to 13 micron). TIS has been configured with an un-cooled micro-bolometer array that saves significantly in terms of weight and power when compared to a cooled IR detector. This payload is developed by Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad.
The instrument features are:


MENCA, a quadrupole mass spectrometer, consists of a filament, detectors and associated electronics system. The detectors being used in MENCA are Channel Electron Multiplier (CEM) and Faraday Cup (FC). A suitable combination of Radio Frequency and DC voltages are applied to the alternate pairs of quadrupole rods to accomplish the mass separation and thereby the determination of partial pressure of species. Also, MENCA has an in-built pressure gauge for the measurement of total pressure. In addition to acquiring the mass spectra in a specified mass range (which can be varied), the instrument has a provision to study the time-evolution of a set of selectable species in the trend mode of operation. The dynamic range of the instrument is in the order of 1010.



Scientific analysis of the data being received from the Mars Orbiter spacecraft is in progress. Scientific Data archived at ISSDC is made available to user communities.",PSLV-C25
